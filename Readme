In this ICMP echo message, you can send to a given IP a request and test if you will get correct reply, input the command :
sudo python3 ./ping.py “hostName” number_of_pings request_period timeout
Then you’ll see a group of feedback telling you how much correct replies you received and the percentage of total requests.
The logica of this program is that firstly we have a Ping class, inside this class we defined send_request and receive_apply these two main functions and other helper functions, finally there is a handelSingleTask to combine all these tasks.
As we have number_of_pings(int from os.argv), then we can call that number of threads and each thread will handle a single task.
if a correct reply is received then a task is finished, or the reply is checked invalid or is not received within given timeout, then we will also end the task.
After all the tasks are done, we give a final report about the situation of all these requests.
